## unsinkable

No reason and no cause
You feed my trust to fire
Burn and level my house
And I rebuild empire

You pull my nerves through my spine
And feed the body to the wolves
Pin on me your devoted crime
And I make my own rules

You broke my bones countless times  
You've blamed me in all the crimes  
It takes more than that to bring me down  
I am unsinkable

## i want

I want to kiss you  
I want to touch you  
I want to hold you  
I want to drown in your eyes  

I want to undress you  
I want to open up to you  
I want to smell you  
I want to hear no more lies  

Forget the world consumed by gray
Hold my hand, let's run away.

Message coming through my brain
I want us to take a train

## flames

I lost something I never had
But that's alright, I understand
This is how I will hold my stand
When flames consume my house

## stuck

I open door after door
I'm looking for you

I'm not strong enough

Like a month to a flame

Going back to you

Running in circles

You got me stuck

You are the reason I can't find somebody new
I every new face, I'm looking for you

everything i know and fear  
in this river between Vega and Altair

i really tried to follow through
but now I am stuck
in catch twenty two

i wake up, I'm a creep
i was flying in my sleep

I'm watching blood drops fall
tap tap tap
ah, crap,
another lap
of endless race
i just can't face
reality alone

the only feeling I've got
is disdain
was it all in vain
repeating the same
words over and over again
in the empty room

and I know i need help
when you ask yourself
no question is rhetorical

I know death, I've seen it in your eyes

Let me out
I'm trapped in your life
I want out

## fake

My smile says friendly
Your brain reads needy

One night stand as surrogate for love

Teasing instead of admiration

## alone

Below is a song from my dream.

Example lyrics with the right meter:

7 And I don't think you're alone
7 And I breathe until you're gone

```text
1    2      3       4       5       6       7
and  i      dont    think   youre   a       lone
and  i      breathe un      til     your    gone
```

## hope

You planted seed, a dark seed in my heart
It grows deep, deeper into dark
Its roots kill, strangle my body
I see no escape, no help from anybody

## ladder

01  i
01  am
01  lost
02  tangled
02  in words
03  with every
04  passing moment
05  just getting closer
07  to my final hopeless edge

01  a
01  day
01  ends
02  but my
02  fear stays
03  burried deep
04  in my dark dreams
05  burried in the head
06  that I refuse to clean
