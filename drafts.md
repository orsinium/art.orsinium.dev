## unsinkable

No reason and no cause
You feed my trust to fire
Burn and level my house
And I rebuild empire

You pull my nerves through my spine
And feed the body to the wolves
Pin on me your devoted crime
And I rules

You broke my bones countless times  
You've blamed me in all the crimes  
It takes more than that to bring me down  
I am unsinkable
