## unsinkable

No reason and no cause
You feed my trust to fire
Burn and level my house
And I rebuild empire

You pull my nerves through my spine
And feed the body to the wolves
Pin on me your devoted crime
And I make my own rules

You broke my bones countless times  
You've blamed me in all the crimes  
It takes more than that to bring me down  
I am unsinkable

## i want

I want to kiss you  
I want to touch you  
I want to hold you  
I want to drown in your eyes  

I want to undress you  
I want to open up to you  
I want to smell you  
I want to hear no more lies  

Forget the world consumed by gray
Hold my hand, let's run away.

Message coming through my brain
I want us to take a train

## flames

I lost something I never had
But that's alright, I understand
This is how I will hold my stand
When flames consume my house

## dance for me

I'm walking the line
You're reading the sign
We're dancing in this broken design.

Dance for me
This is all just a dream
Dance for me
Let me go with the stream

Dance for me
Like you have no emotional cargo
Dance for me
This grim fandango

## stuck

I open door after door
I'm looking for you

I'm not strong enough

Like a month to a flame

Going back to you

Running in circles

You got me stuck

You are the reason I can't find somebody new
I every new face, I'm looking for you

everything i know and fear  
in this river between Vega and Altair

## alone

Below is a song from my dream.

Example lyrics with the right meter:

7 And I don't think you're alone
7 And I breathe until you're gone

```text
1    2      3       4       5       6       7
and  i      dont    think   youre   a       lone
and  i      breathe un      til     your    gone
```

## hope

You planted seed, a dark seed in my heart
It grows deep, deeper into dark
Its roots kill, strangle my body
I see no escape, no help from anybody

## a bee

A bee doesn't know work or service,
It just serves it's purpose.
But do I have a purpose?
Am I any better than a bee?
Can I bee something more than me?

You cannot punish tree into growth;
It grows from roots connected to the world.
You cannot stop from burning wings a moth
With a mere persuation and a simple word.

We tell ourselves that we're the future
We set ourselves aside from nature
We used to run with the wolfes
And now our forests live in books

I keep to tell myself a lie
I want to pupate like a butterfly
Into something new and better
