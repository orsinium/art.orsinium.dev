title: "drifting apart"

I met someone hoping to get closer but only found myself distancing from her. When you anticipate a meeting, you make pretty pictures and plans in your head, and then reality will shutter it.

In this poem, I experimented with more liberal rhymes. I usually try to find the perfect rhyme for each line, but here it's more like what you'll hear in songs. Words are kinda rhyme but not exactly. It's liberating and I tihnk it still sounds good.

I am walking with you  
So close and yet far  
Trying to reach through  
Only drifting apart  

My feet tangled by grass  
I can no longer crawl  
Dark abyss grows between us  
I make a step and fall  

I'm an empty vessel  
For what was filled with hope  
In ruins of this castle  
You won't find me anymore  

<!-- You're words are poison  
You're indifference is blade  
Your look is venom,  
Your silence is a shade.   -->

The person who I knew  
I feel I lost her  
I'm trying to push through...  
But what for?
