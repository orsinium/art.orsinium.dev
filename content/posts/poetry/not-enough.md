Tell jokes  
Take walks  
Get lost in tangled words  

Roll dice  
Brown eyes  
You play it so nice  

Quick cough  
Cute laugh  
I can't get of you enough  

Soft core  
Book store  
I want a bit more  

Dream sea  
Drink tea  
I want us break free  

Novocaine  
Lost game  
Do you feel the same  

Break stuff  
Not enough  
Let's make it more rough  

Just friend  
Can't stand  
Wanna be my girlfriend?
