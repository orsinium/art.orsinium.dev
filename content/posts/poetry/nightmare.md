The structure is similar to [you are](https://art.orsinium.dev/posts/poetry/you-are/) but the theme is polar opposite. This verse is a reflection on going through divorce and learning again to be alone.

I had a nightmare  
That you betrayed my trust  
And love that meant to last  

I had a nightmare  
That you hate me to my core  
And don't want me anymore  

I had a nightmare  
That one morning you were gone  
And I had to live alone  

I had a nightmare  
That you took everything  
Before I could even blink  

I had a nightmare  
That my home was sold  
And your heart turned cold  

I had a nightmare  
That I sleep in empty bed  
And this pain may never end  

I had a nightmare  
That I'm left broken and undone  
And can't connect with anyone  

I have a nightmare  
And I can't wake up
