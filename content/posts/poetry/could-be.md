You could be my friend  
I'd tell you all my secrets  
Trust you to my end  
With all my dreams and pieces  

You could be my sister  
I'd braid your hair with care  
Tell the stories slightly bitter  
But with a bit of hope and dare.  

You could be my lover  
I'd hold you ever close  
And every day I'd discover  
That you're my only rose  

You could be my partner  
I'd build you world meant to last  
Stiching our dreams together  
In a tapestry of trust  

You could be my everything  
But only if you would
