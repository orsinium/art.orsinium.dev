In the life's confusing dance  
We hold ourselves to high standards  
We're afraid to get to party late  
We blame ourselves for a missing date  

We might have missed our first chance  
To cross our ways, to merge the paths  
And in busy life it's hard  
To find a place for another start  

When your mind slowly drifts away  
You might be thinking of that day  
You're sleeping, dreaming off the pain  
But our hearts still beat the same  

If they remember us in their hearts  
They'll remember not our faulty parts  
But the way we keep our heads  
And the way we hold our hands
