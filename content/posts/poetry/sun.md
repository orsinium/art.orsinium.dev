An aatempt into a self-confidence verse, in the spirit of bands like Adelitas Way. Also, it's more heavy on pop-cultural references that usual. How many can you get?

Rust  
Breaks the crust  
And through the dust  
I see the sun  

I'm a fighter, I'm the fire  
I'm the thunder and desire  
I burn brighter than the sun  
I never walk, I always run  

Let the dead bury their dead  
And I will always be looking ahead  
Never hold back, never break down  
Taking my place, stealing my crown  

Don't stand on my way, don't ask me to stay  
I won't rest until my last day  
I don't wanna be home, I don't wanna be safe  
Today I aim to misbehave
