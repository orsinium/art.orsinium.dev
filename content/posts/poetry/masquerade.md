You're cool, you know  
I wish I didn't but I'm kinda in love  
With all my scars and trauma  
I'm afraid to fall for you  
To open up, to get attached  
As always get lonely at the end  
But still...  

I want to be real  
To tell you my mind  
To kiss you  
To be always beside  
Be honest  
Take you on dates  
Protect you  
Make some mistakes  
Share my life  
Share my space  
Hold your hand  
Put smile on your face  
Never be alone  
Always in your sight  
Make it simple  
Make it right  

I WANT!  
I want.  
i want...  

I'll take my feelings and stash them away  
It's time to put a mask for a masquerade  
I'll follow games to make it right  
Play by the rules to not be left behind  

I'm not good at this and I'm afraid  
But I'll do my best to just pretend  
Meet your passion with fake ignorance  
Show off my made up indifference  

I'll care for nothing  
To make you my everything
