Ends  
Everything ends  

One day I will reach last page  
That's it, time to close the book,  
I will step down from the stage  
And throw back one final look  

What will I see?  
Will I see a forest or a tree?  

One day you'll be dreaming, darling  
Walking through a snowy street  
And in your headphones softly playing  
Our favorite music on repeat  

And maybe memory of me was meant to die  
Maybe where you kept me is only a scar  
But maybe you raise your head to the sky  
And notice in the dark a new glowing star  

And in that moment you feel  
Same as you felt the day together  
And that feeling you unseal  
Will light your way forever
