My veins are tangled wires  
Binding ether and my soul  
Drowning in my fears and cares  
I'm waiting for you to call  

I am not leaving my house  
I can hardly talk or crawl  
All social life is on pause  
I'm waiting for you to call  

I pace appartement a few times  
Go sit in silence by the wall  
Consumed by endless thoughts and rhymes  
I am waiting for you to call  

I collapse on the cold ground  
And into deep sleep I fall  
I'm lost but never found  
I don't think you'll ever call
