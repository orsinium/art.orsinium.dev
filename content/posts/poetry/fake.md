Fake laugh, fake smile  
Fake lips, and nails, and mainstream style  
Feeling strangely lonely in the crowd  
Have no words to say, and yet so loud  

No dreams, no ambitions  
No future, misguided volition  
Face frozen in an eternal frown  
Tons of makeup and a cardboard crown  

What's your hobby? Bar hopping.  
What's your music? Electro looping.  
Wanna be loved? Well, maybe at the end  
For now, I will do with one night stand  

Your brain's stuck in Tinder  
Your hair is covered in glitter  
Rings and necklaces covered in gold  
For a cheap price of the world you sold  

Listen, I'll tell you what:  
Better be hated for who you are  
Than to be loved for who you are not
