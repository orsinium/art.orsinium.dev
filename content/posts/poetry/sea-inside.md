This verse is inspired by a line from [CORALINE by MÃ¥neskin](https://genius.com/Genius-english-translations-maneskin-coraline-english-translation-lyrics):

> Coraline is longing for the sea, but is afraid of the water  
> And maybe the sea is inside her

One more day, new victimless crime  
Another tear drowned in a flood  
She'll take step back and take her time  
She's afraid of nothing but be loved  

She is standing by the shore  
And painting in blue the sky  
In pictures never seen before  
She'll mix colors with the light  

Wrecks of ships that are not but were  
She's watching water as the art  
The sea was always inside her  
Waves are beating with her heart  

No more trapped in undertow  
No more leaving with the tight  
She'll rise on surface and above  
And set this time all things right  

She will raise her weightless sail  
Catching up the wind of change  
She'll write with Norns another tale  
Breath in cold air and take the stage
