I'm hollow  
devoid of love and hope  
I'll follow  
the path to me unknown  
In shallow  
water with stream I fade  

My shadow  
is my only companion  
With sorrow  
holding my bleeding soul  
I'll swallow  
my pride and useless hope  

I borrow  
every second from past  
Tomorrow  
is time to pay it back  
On gallow'  
my misery will end  

Life's hollow
