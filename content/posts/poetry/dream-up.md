Wake me up when this is over  
I can't take it any longer  
I feel deeply lost and lonely  
My anxiety is killing me  

Make this nightmare end  
I want to scream and vent  
I want someone to hear  
What I feel and what I fear  

I'm laying in my bed awake  
Despite all the pills I take  
Trying to remember and retrace  
Every word and every phrase  
I ever said  

I want to fall asleep  
And in that sleep go deep  
To find my fears and pain  
And take it all away  

Image what I could dream  

I'd build a whole fake world  
I'd dream up a loving girl  
She'll sleep tightly on my shoulder  
And this will never be over  

I have unwanted love that grows  
And every night it overflows  
Overpowers and oversteps  
Burning thought that never rests
