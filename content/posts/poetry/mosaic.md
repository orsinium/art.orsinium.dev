I wake up in the morning feeling the worst  
I saw you in my sleep and now you're a ghost  
I gaze in my past and I'm afraid what I find  
All I ever wanted is to not be left behind  

I could see your smile, I could taste your lips  
It was real and then the morning turned you into mist  
I condemn my life, I hold myself disdain  
No more sleep if in my sleep I see you again  

These empty hollow shadows dancing in my head  
They keep awake the feelings that I named dead  
You broke my ribs and took my heart when we parted  
You look at me and said too bad we even got started  

Loving is to give her tools that will destroy me  
I plant seed in darkness that will become a tree  
The passion that burns like fire, bright and fast  
With one reckless spark turned my forest into dust  

I'm broken and I'm attracted to broken people  
I wish I could truly smile, even just a little  
I'm a shattered mosaic of everyone I loved a bit  
Even if for a second, even if for a heartbeat
