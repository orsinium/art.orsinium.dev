Every night, before I fade  
I replay every word you ever said  
Trying to figure out what went wrong  
And why  

With the same idea deeply born  
I know the only exit is to move on  
But somehow I just can't  
Let it die  

I want believe it's just a phase  
And yet somehow I cannot face  
That you never really wanted  
Be mine  

My thoughts are looping through the same  
And with the beating heart I exclaim  
My love, oh my love, it's not worth  
A dime  

It's four AM and a quarter  
My eye blinks are getting shorter  
Don't worry, I won't dedicate you  
A line
