The first draft for this was called "shadow". You come through someone's live, cast a quick shadow, leave, and then never remember you again. Or maybe they do but you feel like they left a deeper, much deeper, mark on your life than you on theirs.

That's one of my favorite verses so far in therms of rhytm. It's very easy for me to read and it sounds just right.

I'm not leaving any traces  
And not breaking winter frost  
One of the long forgotten faces  
I'm nothing but a ghost  

Like a tree slashed dead  
Like a day that bleak and hollow  
Like a bird flying over head  
I'm nothing but a shadow  

Like a vow broken long ago  
Like a gold that won't glitter  
Like a sorrow that you saw  
I'm nothing but a whisper  

Through the day and night  
I'll be forever lost  
Gone forever from your sight  
I'm nothing but a ghost
