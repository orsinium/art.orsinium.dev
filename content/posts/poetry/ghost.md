I'm not leaving any traces  
And not breaking winter frost  
One of the long forgotten faces  
I'm nothing but a ghost  

Like a tree slashed dead  
Like a day that bleak and hollow  
Like a bird flying over head  
I'm nothing but a shadow  

Like a vow broken long ago  
Like a gold that won't glitter  
Like a sorrow that you saw  
I'm nothing but a whisper  

Through the day and night  
I'll be forever lost  
Gone forever from your sight  
I'm nothing but a ghost
