A bee doesn't know work or service,  
It just serves it's purpose.  
But do I have a purpose?  
Am I any better than a bee?  
Can I be something more than me?  

You cannot punish tree to grow;  
It grows from roots connected to the world.  
You cannot stop from burning wings a moth  
With a mere persuation and a simple word.  

We tell ourselves that we're the future;  
We set ourselves aside from nature.  
We used to run with the wolfes  
And now our forests live in books.  

I keep to tell myself a lie:  
I want to pupate like a butterfly  
Into something new and better.
