Where are you, dear friend, now  
What are the people you talk  
What are the roads you walk  
What makes your heart go down  

I remember how we were kids  
When we walked through winter ice  
When you looked me in the eyes  
When the first time we kissed  

I remember how you left  
How you drived me insane  
How I was alone again  
How it hurt and how I felt  

I remember how I understood  
Why you chose another way  
Why you decided you can't stay  
Why you left me when you could  

I forgive you everything  
I had a lot to learn  
And when I did, you were gone  
My winter never went to spring  

You're wearing another crown  
All you felt has gone to dust  
I'm just a shadow of your past  
Where are you now?  

<!-- 
Have you given another vow
Have you found a new partner or a passion
Have you felt the same, maybe a fraction
Where are you now?
 -->
