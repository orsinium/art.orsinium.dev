This poem is about nostalgia. About a friend and lover I made 15 years ago. I still remember her fondly but I have no idea how to find and reach her and I probably shouldn't do that anyway.

That's one of the hardest to read poems that I wrote. The 1st line rhymes with 4th instead of 2nd or 3rd which gives it a very asymmetric sound. You really need to emphasize the 1st line, kind of skimp through the 2nd and 3rd, and go back up again on the 4th line.

Where are you, dear friend, now  
What are the people you talk  
What are the roads you walk  
What makes your heart go down  

I remember how we were kids  
When we walked through winter ice  
When you looked me in the eyes  
When the first time we kissed  

I remember how you left  
How you drived me insane  
How I was alone again  
How it hurt and how I felt  

I remember how I understood  
Why you chose another way  
Why you decided you can't stay  
Why you left me when you could  

I forgive you everything  
I had a lot to learn  
And when I did, you were gone  
My winter never went to spring  

You're wearing another crown  
All you felt has gone to dust  
I'm just a shadow of your past  
Where are you now?  

<!-- 
Have you given another vow
Have you found a new partner or a passion
Have you felt the same, maybe a fraction
Where are you now?
 -->
