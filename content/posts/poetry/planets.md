Sometimes, you want to bridge the distance, be with someone else, someone special, but you can't. Then it feels as if you, just like Le Petit Prince, live on your own little planet. And you miss your rose.

On a distant world, wrapped in endless skies  
I remember the flicker in your hazel eyes  
A glimpse so brief, like a star's last breath  
Lost to the silence, to distance and depth  

I send my words through the dark, unseen  
Hoping they find you wherever you've been  
Each line is a bridge across space's expanse  
The language of sound, rhythm, and dance  

One day, perhaps, our worlds will align  
Orbiting closer in cosmic design  
Until that day, through stars I pursue  
I'll write my poems, each one is for you
