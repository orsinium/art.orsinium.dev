You're bringing breaking news  
I'm bad at social cues  
I played the game of love  
And losing it so tough  

Say you never felt this way  
And now I fade into gray  
With one last heroic spin  
All collapsed into bad dream  

I'm left alone, lost and crippled  
No, it never was [perfect simple]  
It was for you just a simple play  
But I only wished that you could say  

That you love me
