I'm sure someone has done it before. The closest that I know is [Fibonacci by Splean](https://genius.com/Splean-fibonacci-lyrics). There is no rhyme, not really. Every new line starts with about the same word as the previous line ends and then 2 last lines of a verse bring back the first 2 lines. Anyway, just take a look.

When the darkness comes  
It comes with silence  
In silence I can be myself  
In myself I see the darkness  
The darkness that brings silence  
  
My brain is full of faulty wires  
Wires that make me make mistakes  
Mistakes bringing me regrets  
Regrets that living in my brain  
The brain full of faulty wires  
  
I want to open up my head  
Go ahead and take out all the mess  
In that mess dig up good parts  
Take apart my fears and dreams  
I just dream to rewire my head  
The head that now holds only mess  
  
I want to find the faulty gear  
The broken gear that made me bitter  
The biterness of broken heart  
In that heart to find love  
To love again with no fear  
Like no gear ever made me bitter
