The melody of this poem is inspired by [He Is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Is_(Ghost_song)) song by Ghost. In the chorus of the song, every line starts with "He is". My verses are less religios and more romantic. Maybe too romantic.

You are  
The sound of my heart  
You are  
The music and the art  
You are  
The melody at the start  
You are  
The missing part  

You are  
The cold stream in spring  
You are  
The name that I sing  
You are  
The ringing string  
You are  
The feather and the wing  

You are  
Very bright and very wise  
You are  
Watching me through hazel eyes  
You are  
The one that always shines  
You are  
The words between the lines  

You are  
Smiling when I rhyme  
You are  
Is why I count time  
You are  
Every laugh and every cry  
You are  
The ocean and the sky  

You are
The one
