This poems is written in [leet-speak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet) using only non-letter ASCII characters: digits and `[!#'`. Which means I can use only 12 letters from English alphabet. This limitation resulted in a poem that is probably the most abstract one I've ever wrote. The feeling I try to convey is "the cold and unwelcoming digital world".

Decoded:

Statistical loss  
Sabotaged too close  
I'll settle the cost  
It is cell I'll host  

Light taste each  
Base total glitch  
Chill as static  
Hectic aestetic  

Select illegal tale  
Steal the ego at sale  
Closest blitz is tactical  
Begs to be illogical
