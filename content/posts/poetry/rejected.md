I'll remember every rejection  
Keep them safe and on display  
In my personal collection  
Of mistakes and misdirection  

For you it's just a compliment  
But what remains to me  
A cold room and empty bed  
Where I will meet my end  

I don't know what future brings  
And I'm, honestly, afraid to know  
If I can handle new fortune swings  
In my kingdom without kings  

Of course I know it will hurt  
But I'll keep trying and failing  
In the end, I just want to be heard  
My every meaning in every word
