We see each other weekly at the class  
I must admit, you're kinda nice  
You're a fairy spinning in a dance  
When your fingers touch my hands  

We get closer, our eyes meet  
I see something growing from this seed  
We enjoy it for a minute, then we talk  
And I invite you later for a walk  

You look away and smile  
This pause burns me for a while  
I feel sinking under heavy force  
Then you look at me and say "of course"  

My voice shakes, my heart jumps away  
Thoughts are rushing through my brain  
She said yes, she said yes  
No more worries, no more stress  

I make step forward and try to hug  
And then I suddenly wake up  
Just a dream? Just a dream?  
I don't believe, I scream  

In all my struggles I lost every fight  
I'm alone, it's the middle of the night  
Alone, alone, in empty bed  
And all I have left is regret
