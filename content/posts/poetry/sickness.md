tears  
for sickness my body bears  
teeth  
scratching won't help breathe  
fever  
makes me wish i was believer  
cough  
reminds me i'm not that tough  
enough  

cold  
taking over my world  
fear  
the only thing i feel clear  
fade  
into lies I made  
shell  
of insecurities i dwell  
unwell  

pain  
running through my brain  
meds  
can't take away regrets  
walls  
are heavy and too close  
again  
insane
