Tears  
for sickness my body bears  
Teeth  
scratching won't help breathe  
Fever  
makes me wish I was believer  
Cough  
reminds me I'm not that tough  
Enough  

Cold  
taking over my world  
Fear  
the only thing I feel clear  
Fade  
into lies I made  
Shell  
of insecurities I dwell  
Unwell  

Pain  
running through my brain  
Meds  
can't take away regrets  
Walls  
are heavy and too close  
Again  
insane
