i pick the stones  
they're like bones  
by the ocean  

i watch the stars  
they are fires  
in the sky  

i draw on sand  
with my hand  
stories never told  

i plant trees  
in a breeze  
from the water  

i tell the wave  
what i crave  
to discover  

i call your name  
still the same  
like first time  

i walk on pier  
still so dear  
as when i saw you  

i set the stones  
like the thrones  
by the ocean
