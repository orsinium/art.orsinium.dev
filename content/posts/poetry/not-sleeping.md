title: "not sleeping"

I already had a poem about missing someone over the long distance: [planets](https://art.orsinium.dev/posts/poetry/planets/). This time, however, it's more about "us being apart" than "me missing you".

If you are not sleeping now
We are together, no matter where you are
If you are not sleeping now
We will meet the sunset, we will light a star

If you are dreaming now
We will see the ocean, we will walk on sand
If you are dreaming now
I will see your smile, you will hold my hand

If you are smiling now
We can handle any troubles, we will know no fear
If you are smiling now
The distance doesn't matter, we are always near

If you are not sleeping now
We are together, just close your eyes
If you are not sleeping now
No matter where you are, we will meet the sunrise
