Remember my name  
When you feel all alone  
And your summer is gone  

Remember my eyes  
When the stars seem dim  
And your hope starts to thin  

Remember my hands  
When the world feels unkind  
And you're searching for guide  

Remember my smile  
When the rain doesn't cease  
And you're longing for peace  

Remember me  
And I'll remember you  
In all that we are  
In all that we do
