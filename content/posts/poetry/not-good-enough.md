You said I am not good enough  
That I do not deserve your love  
We can't end what didn't start  

I thought I had you in my hands  
And now I die by thousand cuts  
Leaving scars on my heart  

It's just another night alone  
And if my body's made of stone  
Nothing will break my spine  

This is how I will hold my stand  
Even though I don't understand  
Why you'll never be mine  

I am still me, I am still free  
Yet I drown in the deepest sea  
Of raining tears I shed  

Nothing new, another heartbreak  
Another leap I'd never make  
And now I'm left for dead  

I miss your laugh, I miss your smile  
I miss the way you walk with style  
I am stuck in the past  

I hoped and begged that you could stay  
I hoped that you will join my way  
This never meant to last
