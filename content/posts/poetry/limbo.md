In this eternal sleepless motion  
I stuck in limbo with no sight  
With each other passing moment  
I get deeper into night  

I keep trying and keep failing  
Scratching knees against cold stone  
And with every wasted evening  
I accept to die alone  

I see a ship in sea dead and calm  
And the motionless white sail  
People praying to all gods  
And all their pleas just fail  

I see how it all began  
And all that happened after  
No waves and the yellow sun  
And the last drop of water  

Even in my imagination  
I feel thirst I can't kill  
I see no escape and no salvation  
But I remember still  

I remember hope  
Believing it will soon be over  
And I won't ever be alone  
And then sinking even lower  

I lost hope for breeze  
I accept cold without warm  
I will not die in peace  
This time I'll pray for storm
