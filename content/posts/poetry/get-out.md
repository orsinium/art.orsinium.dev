Get out of my head  
You belong here no more  
Leaving me bitter and sore  
Pretending to be  
the same as before  

Get out of my life  
Baby, you overstayed  
See, your train is delayed  
And it's time for you  
to be on your way  

Get out of my thoughts  
You're making a mess  
It's all just a test  
For how I can handle  
this spiraling stress  

Get out of my heart  
I can't cover this hole  
That I'm left to atone  
The problem that I  
have to handle alone  

Get out of my day  
I will carry my weight  
Through this misery state  
I'm searching for you  
in every date  

Get out of my dreams  
I'm getting lost in a maze  
And I'm craving some space  
Running again  
in an infinite chase  

Get out of my chats  
I don't want to pretend  
That I'm just a friend  
I only really want  
this nightmare to end  

Get out out out!..  
Please
