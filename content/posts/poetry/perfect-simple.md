I'm so used to girls playing games with me that when one doesn't, I feel surprised. Wait, could it be just that simple? Just opening up and saying what you truly feel?

Someone once said  
I'll be forever lost and single  
I never dreamed  
The love can be so perfect simple  

We don't play games  
We want to open and connect  
No fake claims  
We trust to be honest and direct  

I'll write your voice  
As dreams and poems that I bear  
We made the choice  
And there is nothing left to fear  

And in your eyes  
I see the future that we make  
No need to chace  
Something you can already take  

For once in life  
It all seems so perfect simple
