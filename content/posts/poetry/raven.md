It's one of the few poems where I show a progressing story: the focus goes from me to a raven and then to the raven's scream.

**CONTENT WARNING:** The verse alludes to self-harm, suicide, and death. It's not obvious but it's there. If you find these topics sensitive, don't tempt yourself, skip this verse.

I've died and went back to start  
Lost my time, a dozen years  
Raised a raven in my heart  
Fed it all my pain and tears  

I count from one to five  
Slowly climb up the stage  
I take in hands a knife  
And open up the cage  

The dark raven will fly high  
Beyond what I fear and dream  
In the dark and snowy sky  
For my wounds and loss he'll scream  

That last scream, wherever sent  
Will cut briefly through the dark  
This will be my last lament  
My last flash of dying spark  

It will die, as all the things  
The cold night consuming all  
The raven will spread his wings  
Rise high one last time, and fall
