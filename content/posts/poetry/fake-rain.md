I killed myself yesterday  
In the shower, under fake lights and fake rain  
I cut my veins and let the blood go down the drain  
And then I faded away  

In this demise  
I dreamed of cold and endless darkness  
To be absorbed in nothingness  
And never open my eyes  

To end the game  
To get knocked out from the ring  
To exit the stage of pointless suffering  
And for once be sane  

I woke to silence  
Nothing has changed, same loneliness and gloom  
I'm in my own blood, alone in empty room  
Feeling only absence  

Life is a struggle  
Death is a promise
