The book "Passages" by Gail Sheehy covers crises that everyone goes through in their live. I met a girl going through identity crisis, struggling to find herself and to understand her feelings. This poem is my words of support and encouragement to her. I've been here, I know how you feel, and I don't want you to go through this alone.

Let yourself be tad unstable  
You don't need another label  
Maybe you are queer and quirky  
Finding your own self is tricky  

Keep that cute smile on your face  
Through the life's infinite space  
And you will find sometimes  
Someone who also shines  

I don't know what you dream about  
But I'm happy that I found  
You in a million chance  
That could happen only once  

I will paint in words pictures  
Of our crazy adventures  
The countries that we'll conquer  
And the roads that we'll wander  

The world is confusing place  
If your boat is lost in waves  
I will guide you through the night  
If you just follow my light
