Friends should be comfortable, similar to you, and share all your views and passions. Lovers should be in some ways opposite and sometimes challenge you and your views.

> You're really into Good Omens, are you? My favorite band is Bad Omens. We're better not to mix or there will be an explosion.

I'm a reason, you're a chance  
I'm a song and you're a dance  
I hold the earth, you light the sky  
I'm born to dream and you're to fly  

You're my heaven and I'm your hell  
And we're falling under this spell  
You're a good omen and I'm bad  
And there is never going back  

I don't care that we just met  
I see you're cold, let's share heat  
We'll be always warm together  
In the most snow crazy weather  

You are a fuel for my desire  
I am the night and you're a fire  
You know already what's at stake  
It's time to make your best mistake  

I'm going crazy from your scent  
You know exactly what I meant  
I see already what you want  
Let us mix and we'll explode  

<!-- I am bitter and you are sweet -->
