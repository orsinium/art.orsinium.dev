"[На части](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKvK6Z3NUj0)" ("Into pieces") by [Lumen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(band)) is a song that always makes me cry. Here is a piece of chorus:

| Original | Translation |
|-|-|
| Разбитый на части | Broken into pieces     |
| В поисках счастья | In search for hapiness |
| Ветер в голове    | Wind in the head       |
| И покоя нет       | And no rest            |

The poem below builds on this phrase, mixing in the ideas of [true north](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_north) and [guiding star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_star).

Across the stars of midnight sky  
How should I know which one is mine?  
I'm crumbling, and fighting, and catching the air  
Screaming from top of my lungs and into despair

My true north is lost  
Consumed by the winter frost  
Through the loss and through the stress  
I'm left alone, directionless

Wind pushes me ahead  
Until the moment I drop dead  
Peace of mind is just a dream  
And I'm consumed by the endless stream

In pursuit of happiness  
I'm broken into pieces
