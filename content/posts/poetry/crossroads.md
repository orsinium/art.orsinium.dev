Falling in love is never easy, especially when you are a grown up with responsibilities. I will always follow logic and reason and the poetry is my way to scream my feelings.

The lines imperfection  
Severed connection  
The feelings on mute  
Burried with a twenty one gun salute

Then a spark that rekindles fire  
Gives a birth to new desire  
The peace, the rest explodes  
And I'm standing at crossroads

The first road is forget, pretend, release  
Close my eyes, set my life to freeze  
And forever hide  
What my heart now holds behind

The second road is to let the fire burn  
To live the moment and to fight  
To never let you from my sight  
But... Would it be right?

Here you stand, dazzled and lost  
Paying for my decisions cost  
I'm breaking your heart, I'm breaking my peace  
Losing all to this disease

I sold the world for one day  
And I wish that you could stay  
For a moment longer
