This one starts in my regular slow poetical rhythm and then breaks into very short and sharp verses. Maybe it could've been a song.

You're throwing away the roses  
And I'm counting my loses  
I won't lose my peace because  
This battle is a lost cause  

You're nothing but a ghost  
Yeah, sure, I lost  
The reality grip  
I might've seen you in sleep  

Never again  
Getting the strain  
Of this shame  
Through my vein  
Leaving a stain  
On my fame  
All in vain  
Going insane  
Crushing a plain  
Wrecking a train  
Through the lane  
Through my brain  
Through the day  
Through the pain  

I'll never be the same
